    <p>
      Dear {{FIRST_NAME}},
    </p>

    <p>
      We hope that you are doing very well, and that you had a wonderful start of 2026!
    </p>
    
    <p>
      MOMRI is excited to share that we welcomed nine official Affiliates in 2025. They are: Geoff Baker, Mary Cohen, Gideon Danja, Gillian Howell, Fiona Magowan, Phil Mullen, Ai Nakatsuka, Andrea Rodríguez-Sánchez, and Kevin Shorner-Johnson. <b>Please learn more about them <a href="https://hub.institute.min-on.org/affiliates">here</a>!</b>  
    </p>

    <p>
      In 2026, we are expanding our internal capacity to be able to offer more sustained support to the Music in Peacebuilding field. We are dedicating regular staff time to the <a href="https://hub.institute.min-on.org">MOMRI Hub</a> and to accompanying projects in development, and <b>we warmly welcome conversations about possible collaborations and/or ways we might be of support.</b>
    </p>
    
    <p>
      Kicking off this January are MOMRI's Open Office Hours (on Google Meet). These are informal, drop-in conversations -- stop by to introduce yourself, talk things through, ask questions, or  connect with others in the field. Elaine will host Open Office Hours -- <b>please email <a href="mailto:e.sandoval@min-on.org?subject=MOMRI%20Office%20Hours%20Details">e.sandoval@min-on.org</a> if you'd like the Google Meet details!</b>  
    </p>

    <p>
      Moving forward, we'll also be establishing a quarterly email newsletter. <b>Please <a href="https://hub.institute.min-on.org/newsletter-form">let us know</a></b> if you're happy to continue receiving communications from us at this email address, or if you'd prefer to opt out. (Or, if it's more convenient, simply reply to this email.)
    </p>

    <p>
      We're wishing you the very best in 2026, and we look forward to continue building together!
    </p>
